Version 0.1.1
-------------

2010-01-xx

Added auto delete feature. When enabled, upon the completion of a download,
images that were successfully downloaded will be deleted from the image device
they were downloaded from. Images that were not downloaded successfully will not
be deleted. 

Added keyboard accelerators for Preferences and Help.

Updated Czech, German, Slovak and Spanish translations.


Version 0.1.0
-------------

2009-12-07

Added icons to notification messages.

Updated Czech, French, German, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish and
Swedish translations.

Bug fix: properly handle devices being unmounted, fixing a bug introduced in
Version 0.0.9 beta 2.

Bug fix: When program preferences are changed, image and backup devices are now 
refreshed only when the preferences dialog window is closed.

Bug fix: Minutes component of image and folder renaming had the same code as 
months.


Version 0.1.0 beta 2
--------------------

2009-11-22

New feature: when detection of portable storage devices is selected, the program
will prompt you whether or not to download from each device it automatically
detects. You can choose whether the program should remember the choice you make
every time it runs. This fixes bug #376020.

Fixed bug #484432: error in adding job codes via the preferences dialog.

Fixed bug #486886: Job code prompt can appear multiple times.

Updated Hungarian and French translations.


Version 0.1.0 beta 1
--------------------

2009-11-14

This code is ready for full release, but given the magnitude of changes, a beta
seems like a good idea, simply to catch any undetected bugs.

Added a "Job codes" option. Like the "text" option in image and subfolder name
generation, this allows you to specify text that will be placed into the file
and subfolder names. However, unlike the "text" option, which requires that the
text be directly entered via the program preferences, when using the "Job code"
option, the program will prompt for it each time a download begins. 

Made Download button the default button. Hitting enter while the main window
has focus will now start the download.

Fixed bug #387002: added dependency in Ubuntu packages for librsvg2-common. 
Thanks go to user hasp for this fix.

Fixed bug #478620: problem with corrupted image files. Thanks go to user Katrin
Krieger for tracking this one down.

Fixed bug #479424: some camera model names do not have numbers, but it still
makes sense to return a shortened name. Thanks go to user Wesley Harp for 
highlighting this problem.

Fixed bug #482831: program no longer crashes when auto-download is off, and a 
device is inserted before another download has completed.

Added Czech translation by Tomas Novak.

Added French translation by Julien Valroff, Michel Ange, and Cenwen.

Added Hungarian translation by Balazs Oveges and Andras Lorincz.

Added Slovak translation by Tomas Novak.

Added Swedish translation by Ulf Urden and Michal Predotka.

Added dependency on gnome-icon-theme in Ubuntu packages.

Added additional hour, minute and second options in image renaming and subfolder
creation. Thanks to Art Zemon for the patch.

Malformed image date time exif values have are minimally checked to see if they
can still be used for subfolder and image renaming. Some software programs seem
to make a mess of them.

Updated man page, including a bug fix by Julien Valroff.


Version 0.0.10
--------------

2009-06-05

Updated Russian translation by Sergei Sedov.

Fixed bug #383028: program would crash when using an automatically configured 
backup device and gvfs.



Version 0.0.9
-------------

2009-06-02

Added Italian translation by Marco Solari and Luca Reverberi.

Added German translation by Martin Egger and Daniel Passler.

Added Russian translation by Sergei Sedov.

Added Finnish translation by Mikko Ruohola.

A Help button has been added to Preferences dialog window. Clicking it takes you
to the documentation found online at the program's website. This documentation 
is now complete.

The Preferences Dialog Window is now navigated using a list control, as it was
in early versions of the program. This change was necesseary because with some
translations, the dialog window was becoming too wide with the normal tab 
layout. Usability of the preferences dialog is improved: it will now resize 
itself based on its content.

Better integration with Nautilus is now possible through the setting of 
MimeType=x-content/image-dcf in the program's .desktop file.



Version 0.0.9 beta 4
--------------------

2009-05-26

Added Spanish translation by Jose Luis Navarro and Abel O'Rian.

Whenever subfolder preferences are modified in the Preferences Dialog window,
they are now checked to see if they contain any extraneous entries. If 
necessary, any entries like this are removed when the dialog window is closed.

Bug fix: Changes in preferences should be applied to devices that have already
been scanned, but their images not yet downloaded. This bug was introduced in 
beta 2 when fixing bug #368098.

Bug fix: check subfolder preferences for validity before beginning download. 
While image rename preferences were checked, this check was neglected.

Bug fix: do not allow automatic downloading when there is an error in the
preferences.



Version 0.0.9 beta 3
--------------------

2009-05-25

Added command line options for controlling verbosity, displaying which image
file types are recognized, and printing the program version.

Updated man page to reflect recent program changes and new command line options.

Prepared program for translation into other languages. Thanks go to Mark Mruss 
and his blog http://www.learningpython.com for code examples and explanations.

Polish translation by Michal Predotka. Coming soon: French, German and
Spanish translations.

To install the program using python setup.py, the program msgfmt must now be
present. On most Linux distributions, this is found in the package gettext.

Updated INSTALL file to reflect minimum version of pyexiv2 needed, and included
information about handling any error related to msgfmt not being installed.

Minor fixes to logic that checks whether the Download button should be disabled
or not. This should now be more reliable.

Bug fix: error log window can now be reopened after being closed with the "x" 
button. Thanks go to ESR and his Python FAQ entry for this fix.

Bug fix: example of subfolder name now has word wrap. Thanks go to Michal
Predotka for reporting this.

Bug fix: don't crash when a thumbnail image is missing and the 'orientation'
variable has not yet been assigned.



Version 0.0.9 beta 2
--------------------

2009-05-12

By popular demand, allow direct downloading from cameras. This support is
experimental and may not work with your camera. This is possible through the use
of the new gvfs service, provided by GIO, that exists in recent versions of
Linux. A recent version of Linux is a must. The camera must also be supported by
libgphoto2 in combination with gvfs. If you cannot browse the camera's contents
in a file manager (e.g. Nautilus), the camera download will not work until the
gvfs support is improved.

Although this is a popular request, the reality is that downloading images
directly from the camera is often extremely slow in comparison to popping the
memory card into a card reader and downloading from that. 

Fix bug #368098: the program now starts more quickly and does not become
unresponsive when scanning devices with a large number of images. This will
hardly be noticeable by users that download from memory cards, but for those
who download from hard drives with hundreds of GBs of files -- they'll notice
a big difference.

Fix bug #372284: for image renaming, the "image number" component is more 
robust. Now, only the series of digits at the end of a filename are recognized 
as the image number (obviously the file's extension is not included as being
part of the filename in this case). This allows takes in account files from
cameras like the Canon 1D series, which can have filenames like VD1D7574.CR2.

Bug fix: don't download from volumes mounted while the program is already 
running unless auto detection is specified. This bug could occur when auto
detection was enabled, then disabled, and then a volume was mounted.



Version 0.0.8
-------------

2009-05-01

Added stored and downloads today sequence numbers:

* The stored sequence number is remembered each time the program is run.

* Downloads today tracks how many downloads are made on a given day. The time a
  day "starts" is set via a new preference value, day start. This is useful if
  you often photograph something late at night (e.g. concerts) and want a new
  day to "start" at 3am, for instance.

Make estimate of time remaining to download images much more accurate.

Display download speed in status bar.

Reorganized sequence number/letter selection in preferences.

Add feature to detect change in program version, upgrading preferences where
necessary.

Only allow one instance of the program to be run -- raise existing window if it
is run again. This is very useful when Rapid Photo Downloader is set to run
automatically upon insertion of a memory card.

Add "exit at end of successful download" automation feature.

When an image's download is skipped, the thumbnail is now lightened.

Show a missing image icon if the thumbnail cannot be displayed for some reason.
(See bug #369640 for why thumbnail images from certain RAW files are not 
displayed).

Resize main window when an image device is inserted -- it now expands to show
each device that is inserted.

Do not proceed with download if there is an error in the image rename or
download subfolder preferences. Instead, indicate a download error.

Allow version 0.1.1 of pyexiv2 to be used (an older version of the library code
that is used to get information on the images, found in distributions like 
Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron).

In cases where image rename or download subfolder preferences are invalid, 
more helpful information is printed to the console output.

Bug fix: better handle automated shortening Canon names like 'Canon 5D Mark II'.
It is now shortened to '5DMkII' instead of merely '5D'.

Bug fix: reenable example of image renaming and subfolder name generation by
using first image from the first available download device. This was
inadvertently disabled in an earlier beta.

Bug fix: make default download subfolder YYYY/YYYYMMDD again. It was
inadvertently set to DDMMYYYY/YYYYMMDD in beta 6.

Bug fix: don't change download button label to "pause" when "Start downloading
on program startup" is set to true.

Bug fix: implement code to warn / give error about missing backup devices.

Bug fix: reset progress bar after completion of successful download.

Fix bug #317404 when clearing completed downloads.



Version 0.0.8 beta 7
--------------------

2009-04-07

Added serial number metadata option for select Nikon, Canon, Olympus, Fuji, 
Panasonic, and Kodak cameras.

Added shutter count metadata option for select Nikon cameras, e.g. Nikon D300,
D3 etc.

Add owner name metadata option for select Canon cameras, e.g. 5D Mk II etc.


Version 0.0.8 beta 6
--------------------

2009-03-31

Implement add unique identifier when file name is not unique.

Added "Report a Problem", "Get Help Online", "Make a Donation" to Help menu.

Implemented "Clear completed downloads" menu item.

Download images in order they were taken (checked by time they modified).

Fixed bug where choosing text as the first item in a download subfolder caused a
crash.

Fixed bug where date and time choices based on when image is downloaded caused a
crash.

Initial code to show error message when image renaming preferences have an 
error.

Fixed bug where some invalid preferences were not being caught.

Run default python, not one specified in env, as per recommendations in Debian
Python Policy.

Remove initial period from filename extension when generating a subfolder name 
(or else the folder will be hidden).

Check to see if metadata is essential to generate image names is now more 
robust.

Remove list control from preferences, reverting to normal tabbed preferences, 
as the window was becoming too wide.

Show notifcations via libnotify.

Error and warning icons can now be clicked on to open log window.

Finally, last but certainly not least--implemented sequence number and sequence
letter generation:
 * session sequence number
 * sequence letter
Coming soon:
 * downloads today sequence number
 * subfolder sequence number
 * stored sequence number

very ugly indeed.

Wrap new filename in image rename preferences when it becomes too long.

Make default download folder selection more robust.
