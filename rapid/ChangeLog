Version 0.3.2
-------------

2010-09-12

Added Norwegian Nynorsk translation. Updated Chinese, Finnish, Hungarian, Dutch, 
Occitan (post 1500), Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, and Russian translations.

Fixed crash on startup when checking for freespace, and the download folder does
not exist.


Version 0.3.1
-------------

2010-08-13

The main window now works more effectively on tiny screens, such as those found
on netbooks. If the screen height is less than or equal to 650 pixels, elements
in the preview pane are removed, and the spacing is tightened.

The amount of free space available on the filesystem where photos are to be
downloaded is now displayed in the status bar. (Note this is only the case on
moderately up-to-date Linux distributions that use GVFS, such as Ubuntu 8.10 or
higher).

Add Chinese (simplified) translation. A big thanks goes out to the Ubuntu 
Chinese translation team. Partial translations of Bulgarian, Japanese, Occitan 
(post 1500), Persian, Portuguese (Brazilian), and Turkish have been added. In
the past only translations that were largely finished were added, but hopefully 
adding incomplete translations will speed up their completion. Updated Finnish, 
French, Hungarian, Russian, Serbian and Spanish translations.


Version 0.3.0
-------------

2010-07-10

The major new feature of this release is the generation of previews before
a download takes place. You can now select which photos and videos you wish to
download.

You can now assign different Job Codes to photos and videos in the same 
download. Simply select photos and videos, and from the main window choose a Job
Code for them. You can select a new Job Code,or enter a new one (press Enter
to apply it). 

The errors and warnings reported have been completely overhauled, and are now
more concise.

Now that you can select photos and videos to download, the "Report an error" 
option in case of filename conflicts has been removed. If you try to download a
photo or video that already exists, an error will be reported. If you backup a 
photo or video that already exists in the backup location, a warning will be 
reported (regardless of whether overwriting or skipping of backups with 
conflicting filenames is chosen). 

Likewise, the option of whether to report an error or warning in case of missing
backup devices has been removed. If you have chosen to backup your photos and
videos, and a backup device or location is not found, the files will be 
downloaded with warnings.

For each device in the main window, the progress bar is now updated much more
smoothly than before. This is useful when downloading and backing up large files
such as videos. (Note this is only the case on moderately up-to-date Linux 
distributions that use GVFS, such as Ubuntu 8.10 or higher).

The minimum version of python-gtk2 (pygtk) required to run the program is now
2.12. This will affect only outdated Linux distributions.


Version 0.3.0 beta 6
--------------------

2010-07-06

Fixed bug #598736: don't allow file to jump to the bottom when it has a Job Code
assigned to it.

Fixed bug #601993: don't prompt for a Job Code when downloading file of one type
(photo or video), and it's only a file of the other type that needs it.

Log error messages are now cleaned up where a file already exists and there were
problems generating the file / subfolder name.

Fixed crash on startup when using an old version of GIO.

Fix crash in updating the time remaining in when downloading from extremely
slow devices.

Set the default height to be 50 pixels taller.

Bug fix: don't download from device that has been inserted after program starts
unless device auto detection is enabled.

Updated German translation.


Version 0.3.0 beta 5
--------------------

2010-07-04

Added warning dialog if attempting to download directly from a camera.

Add backup errors details to error log window.

Fixed program notifications.

Fixed corner cases with problematic file and subfolder names.

Disabled Download All button if all files that have not been downloaded have
errors. 

Enabled and disabled Download All button, depending on status, after subfolder 
or filename preferences are modified after device has been scanned. 

Don't stop a file being downloaded if a valid subfolder or filename can be
generated using a Job Code.

Bug fix: don't automatically exit if there were errors or warnings and a 
download was occuring from more than one device.

Auto start now works correctly again.

Job Codes are now assigned correctly when multiple downloads occur. 

Default column sorting is by date, unless a warning or error occurs when 
doing the initial scan of the devices, in which case it is set to status (unless
you have already clicked on a column heading yourself, in which case it will
not change).

Use the command xdg-user-dir to get default download directories.

Updated Czech, Dutch, Finnish, French, Italian, Polish, Russian and Ukrainian
translations.
 

Version 0.3.0 beta 4
--------------------

2010-06-25

Fixed bug in Job Code addition in the preferences window.

Made Job Code entry completion case insensitive.

Update preview to be the most recently selected photo / video when 
multiple files are selected.

Don't crash when user selects a row that has its status set to be 
download pending.

Improve error log status messages and problem notifications.


Version 0.3.0 beta 3
--------------------

2010-06-23

First beta release of 0.3.0. 


Version 0.2.3
-------------

2010-06-23

Updated Hungarian, Russian, Swedish and Ukrainian translations.

Fixed bug #590725: don't crash if the theme does not associate an icon with 
the detected device.

Bug fix: update example filenames and folders when Job codes are manually 
modified in the preferences window.

This is the final release before 0.3.0, which will be a major update.


Version 0.2.2
-------------

2010-06-06

Added Ukrainian translation by Sergiy Gavrylov.

Bug fix: in systems where exiv2 is not installed, don't crash on startup.


Version 0.2.1
-------------

2010-06-05

Bug fix: display sample photo and video names in preferences dialog using
first photo and video found on download device, where possible. This used to
work but was inadvertently disabled in a recent release.

Bug fix: prompt for Job code when only video names or video subfolder names
use a job code.

Bug fix: filter out Null bytes from Exif string values. These can occur when
the Exif data is corrupted.

Updated Spanish, Russian and Finnish translations.


Version 0.2.0
-------------

2010-05-30

Videos can now be downloaded in much the same way photos can. 

The package kaa metadata is required to download videos. ffmpegthumbnailer is
used to display thumbnail images of certain types of videos as the download
occurs. 

kaa metadata and ffmpegthumbnailer are optional. The program will run without
them. See the INSTALL file for details.

If a THM file with the same name as the video is present, it will be used to 
generate a thumbnail for the video. If not, if ffmpegthumbnailer is installed, 
Rapid Photo Downloader will use it to attempt to extract a thumbnail from the
video. THM files are not downloaded.

For now, sequence values are shared between the downloads of videos and photos.
There may be an option to have two sets of sequence numbers in a future release.

Due to the number of changes in the code, it is possible that regressions in the
photo downloading code may have been introduced. 

This is the first release to use version 0.2.x of the pyexiv2 library.  The 
most immediate benefit of this change is that thumbnail images from Nikon and 
other brand cameras can be displayed. This fixes bugs #369640 and #570378.

Please note pyexiv2 0.2.x requires exiv2 0.1.9 or above.

Rapid Photo Downloader will still work with pyexiv2 0.1.x. However it will not
be able to display the thumbnails of some brands of camera.

If Rapid Photo Downloader detects version 0.18.1 or higher of the exiv2
library, it will download Panasonic's RW2 files. If it detects version 0.18.0 or
higher of the exiv2 library, it will download Mamiya's MEF files. For Rapid
Photo Downloader to be able to detect which version of the exiv2 library your
system has, it must either be running pyexiv2 >= 0.2.0, or have exiv2 installed.

Fixed bug #483222: sometimes images could not be downloaded to NTFS partitions.
This fix was a welcome side effect of using GIO to copy images, instead of 
relying on the python standard libary.

Error message headings in the Error Log are now displayed in a red font.

Program settings and preferences can be reset using a new command line option.

Program preferences are now more thoroughly checked for validity when the
program starts. 

Further work was done to fix bug #505492, to handle cases where the system
notification system is not working properly.


Version 0.1.3
-------------

2010-01-22

Fixed bug #509348: When both the backup and "Delete images from image device 
upon download completion" options are selected, the program will only delete 
an image from the image device if it was both downloaded to the download folder 
and backed up. Previously it did not check to ensure it was backed up 
correctly too.

Fixed bug #505492: Program failed to start in environments where the 
notification system has problems.

Fixed bug #508304: User is now prompted to confirm if they really want to 
remove all of their Job Codes after clicking on "Remove All" in the preferences
dialog window.

Fixed bug #510484: Crashes when fails to create temporary download directory.

Fixed bug #510516: Program now checks to see if the download folder exists and
is writeable. If automatic detection of image devices is not enabled, it checks
to see if the image location path exists.

Updated Czech, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, 
Russian, Serbian, Spanish and Swedish translations.


Version 0.1.2
-------------

2010-01-16

New feature: photographers using RAW + JPEG mode now have the option to 
synchronize sequence numbers for the matching pair of images. This option is
useful if you use the RAW + JPEG feature on your camera and you use sequence
numbers or letters in your image renaming. Enabling this option will cause the 
program to detect matching pairs of RAW and JPEG images, and when they are 
detected, the same sequence numbers and letters will be applied to both image
names. Furthermore, sequences will be updated as if the images were one. For 
example, if 200 RAW images and 200 matching JPEG images are downloaded, the 
value of Downloads today will be incremented by 200, and not 400. The same goes 
for the rest of the sequence values, including the Stored number sequence 
number. Images are detected by comparing filename, as well as the exif value for
the date and time the image was created (including subseconds when the camera 
records this value). This option will take effect regardless of whether the RAW 
and JPEG images are stored on different memory cards or the same memory card. 
Furthermore, if they are stored on separate memory cards, you can download from 
them simultaneously or one after the other. The only requirement is to download 
the images in the same session--in other words, for the feature to work, use as 
many memory cards as you need, but do not exit the program between downloads of 
the matching sets of images.

Increased maximum sequence number length to seven digits by user request.

Fixed bug #503704: changes in values for downloads today and stored number not
updated when changed via program preferences while a download is ready to begin.

Fixed a rare startup bug, where the program could crash when starting a thread.

Added Serbian translation by Milos Popovic. Updated Czech, Dutch, Finnish,
French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish and 
Swedish translations.


Version 0.1.1
-------------

2010-01-05

Added auto delete feature. When enabled, upon the completion of a download,
images that were successfully downloaded will be deleted from the image device
they were downloaded from. Images that were not downloaded successfully will not
be deleted. 

Added keyboard accelerators for Preferences and Help.

Added Dutch translation by Alian J. Baudrez. Updated Czech, French, German, 
Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Slovak and Spanish translations.


Version 0.1.0
-------------

2009-12-07

Added icons to notification messages.

Updated Czech, French, German, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish and
Swedish translations.

Bug fix: properly handle devices being unmounted, fixing a bug introduced in
Version 0.0.9 beta 2.

Bug fix: When program preferences are changed, image and backup devices are now 
refreshed only when the preferences dialog window is closed.

Bug fix: Minutes component of image and folder renaming had the same code as 
months.


Version 0.1.0 beta 2
--------------------

2009-11-22

New feature: when detection of portable storage devices is selected, the program
will prompt you whether or not to download from each device it automatically
detects. You can choose whether the program should remember the choice you make
every time it runs. This fixes bug #376020.

Fixed bug #484432: error in adding job codes via the preferences dialog.

Fixed bug #486886: Job code prompt can appear multiple times.

Updated Hungarian and French translations.


Version 0.1.0 beta 1
--------------------

2009-11-14

This code is ready for full release, but given the magnitude of changes, a beta
seems like a good idea, simply to catch any undetected bugs.

Added a "Job codes" option. Like the "text" option in image and subfolder name
generation, this allows you to specify text that will be placed into the file
and subfolder names. However, unlike the "text" option, which requires that the
text be directly entered via the program preferences, when using the "Job code"
option, the program will prompt for it each time a download begins. 

Made Download button the default button. Hitting enter while the main window
has focus will now start the download.

Fixed bug #387002: added dependency in Ubuntu packages for librsvg2-common. 
Thanks go to user hasp for this fix.

Fixed bug #478620: problem with corrupted image files. Thanks go to user Katrin
Krieger for tracking this one down.

Fixed bug #479424: some camera model names do not have numbers, but it still
makes sense to return a shortened name. Thanks go to user Wesley Harp for 
highlighting this problem.

Fixed bug #482831: program no longer crashes when auto-download is off, and a 
device is inserted before another download has completed.

Added Czech translation by Tomas Novak.

Added French translation by Julien Valroff, Michel Ange, and Cenwen.

Added Hungarian translation by Balazs Oveges and Andras Lorincz.

Added Slovak translation by Tomas Novak.

Added Swedish translation by Ulf Urden and Michal Predotka.

Added dependency on gnome-icon-theme in Ubuntu packages.

Added additional hour, minute and second options in image renaming and subfolder
creation. Thanks to Art Zemon for the patch.

Malformed image date time exif values have are minimally checked to see if they
can still be used for subfolder and image renaming. Some software programs seem
to make a mess of them.

Updated man page, including a bug fix by Julien Valroff.


Version 0.0.10
--------------

2009-06-05

Updated Russian translation by Sergei Sedov.

Fixed bug #383028: program would crash when using an automatically configured 
backup device and gvfs.



Version 0.0.9
-------------

2009-06-02

Added Italian translation by Marco Solari and Luca Reverberi.

Added German translation by Martin Egger and Daniel Passler.

Added Russian translation by Sergei Sedov.

Added Finnish translation by Mikko Ruohola.

A Help button has been added to Preferences dialog window. Clicking it takes you
to the documentation found online at the program's website. This documentation 
is now complete.

The Preferences Dialog Window is now navigated using a list control, as it was
in early versions of the program. This change was necesseary because with some
translations, the dialog window was becoming too wide with the normal tab 
layout. Usability of the preferences dialog is improved: it will now resize 
itself based on its content.

Better integration with Nautilus is now possible through the setting of 
MimeType=x-content/image-dcf in the program's .desktop file.



Version 0.0.9 beta 4
--------------------

2009-05-26

Added Spanish translation by Jose Luis Navarro and Abel O'Rian.

Whenever subfolder preferences are modified in the Preferences Dialog window,
they are now checked to see if they contain any extraneous entries. If 
necessary, any entries like this are removed when the dialog window is closed.

Bug fix: Changes in preferences should be applied to devices that have already
been scanned, but their images not yet downloaded. This bug was introduced in 
beta 2 when fixing bug #368098.

Bug fix: check subfolder preferences for validity before beginning download. 
While image rename preferences were checked, this check was neglected.

Bug fix: do not allow automatic downloading when there is an error in the
preferences.



Version 0.0.9 beta 3
--------------------

2009-05-25

Added command line options for controlling verbosity, displaying which image
file types are recognized, and printing the program version.

Updated man page to reflect recent program changes and new command line options.

Prepared program for translation into other languages. Thanks go to Mark Mruss 
and his blog http://www.learningpython.com for code examples and explanations.

Polish translation by Michal Predotka. Coming soon: French, German and
Spanish translations.

To install the program using python setup.py, the program msgfmt must now be
present. On most Linux distributions, this is found in the package gettext.

Updated INSTALL file to reflect minimum version of pyexiv2 needed, and included
information about handling any error related to msgfmt not being installed.

Minor fixes to logic that checks whether the Download button should be disabled
or not. This should now be more reliable.

Bug fix: error log window can now be reopened after being closed with the "x" 
button. Thanks go to ESR and his Python FAQ entry for this fix.

Bug fix: example of subfolder name now has word wrap. Thanks go to Michal
Predotka for reporting this.

Bug fix: don't crash when a thumbnail image is missing and the 'orientation'
variable has not yet been assigned.



Version 0.0.9 beta 2
--------------------

2009-05-12

By popular demand, allow direct downloading from cameras. This support is
experimental and may not work with your camera. This is possible through the use
of the new gvfs service, provided by GIO, that exists in recent versions of
Linux. A recent version of Linux is a must. The camera must also be supported by
libgphoto2 in combination with gvfs. If you cannot browse the camera's contents
in a file manager (e.g. Nautilus), the camera download will not work until the
gvfs support is improved.

Although this is a popular request, the reality is that downloading images
directly from the camera is often extremely slow in comparison to popping the
memory card into a card reader and downloading from that. 

Fix bug #368098: the program now starts more quickly and does not become
unresponsive when scanning devices with a large number of images. This will
hardly be noticeable by users that download from memory cards, but for those
who download from hard drives with hundreds of GBs of files -- they'll notice
a big difference.

Fix bug #372284: for image renaming, the "image number" component is more 
robust. Now, only the series of digits at the end of a filename are recognized 
as the image number (obviously the file's extension is not included as being
part of the filename in this case). This allows takes in account files from
cameras like the Canon 1D series, which can have filenames like VD1D7574.CR2.

Bug fix: don't download from volumes mounted while the program is already 
running unless auto detection is specified. This bug could occur when auto
detection was enabled, then disabled, and then a volume was mounted.



Version 0.0.8
-------------

2009-05-01

Added stored and downloads today sequence numbers:

* The stored sequence number is remembered each time the program is run.

* Downloads today tracks how many downloads are made on a given day. The time a
  day "starts" is set via a new preference value, day start. This is useful if
  you often photograph something late at night (e.g. concerts) and want a new
  day to "start" at 3am, for instance.

Make estimate of time remaining to download images much more accurate.

Display download speed in status bar.

Reorganized sequence number/letter selection in preferences.

Add feature to detect change in program version, upgrading preferences where
necessary.

Only allow one instance of the program to be run -- raise existing window if it
is run again. This is very useful when Rapid Photo Downloader is set to run
automatically upon insertion of a memory card.

Add "exit at end of successful download" automation feature.

When an image's download is skipped, the thumbnail is now lightened.

Show a missing image icon if the thumbnail cannot be displayed for some reason.
(See bug #369640 for why thumbnail images from certain RAW files are not 
displayed).

Resize main window when an image device is inserted -- it now expands to show
each device that is inserted.

Do not proceed with download if there is an error in the image rename or
download subfolder preferences. Instead, indicate a download error.

Allow version 0.1.1 of pyexiv2 to be used (an older version of the library code
that is used to get information on the images, found in distributions like 
Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron).

In cases where image rename or download subfolder preferences are invalid, 
more helpful information is printed to the console output.

Bug fix: better handle automated shortening Canon names like 'Canon 5D Mark II'.
It is now shortened to '5DMkII' instead of merely '5D'.

Bug fix: reenable example of image renaming and subfolder name generation by
using first image from the first available download device. This was
inadvertently disabled in an earlier beta.

Bug fix: make default download subfolder YYYY/YYYYMMDD again. It was
inadvertently set to DDMMYYYY/YYYYMMDD in beta 6.

Bug fix: don't change download button label to "pause" when "Start downloading
on program startup" is set to true.

Bug fix: implement code to warn / give error about missing backup devices.

Bug fix: reset progress bar after completion of successful download.

Fix bug #317404 when clearing completed downloads.



Version 0.0.8 beta 7
--------------------

2009-04-07

Added serial number metadata option for select Nikon, Canon, Olympus, Fuji, 
Panasonic, and Kodak cameras.

Added shutter count metadata option for select Nikon cameras, e.g. Nikon D300,
D3 etc.

Add owner name metadata option for select Canon cameras, e.g. 5D Mk II etc.


Version 0.0.8 beta 6
--------------------

2009-03-31

Add YYYY-MM-DD and YY-MM-DD options in date time renaming, suggested by
Andreas F.X. Siegert and Paul Gear.

Fix bug #352242 where image has no metadata.

Handle images with corrupt metadata more gracefully.


Version 0.0.8 beta 5

Make file renaming thread safe, fixing a long-standing (if difficult to 
activate) bug.

Implement add unique identifier when file name is not unique.

Added "Report a Problem", "Get Help Online", "Make a Donation" to Help menu.

Implemented "Clear completed downloads" menu item.

Download images in order they were taken (checked by time they modified).

Fixed bug where choosing text as the first item in a download subfolder caused a
crash.

Fixed bug where date and time choices based on when image is downloaded caused a
crash.

Initial code to show error message when image renaming preferences have an 
error.

Fixed bug where some invalid preferences were not being caught.

Run default python, not one specified in env, as per recommendations in Debian
Python Policy.

Remove initial period from filename extension when generating a subfolder name 
(or else the folder will be hidden).

Check to see if metadata is essential to generate image names is now more 
robust.

Remove list control from preferences, reverting to normal tabbed preferences, 
as the window was becoming too wide.

Show notifcations via libnotify.

Error and warning icons can now be clicked on to open log window.

Finally, last but certainly not least--implemented sequence number and sequence
letter generation:
 * session sequence number
 * sequence letter
Coming soon:
 * downloads today sequence number
 * subfolder sequence number
 * stored sequence number
 

Version 0.0.7
-------------

2009-01-13

Implemented option for automatic detection of Portal Storage Devices.

very ugly indeed.

Wrap new filename in image rename preferences when it becomes too long.

Make default download folder selection more robust.

Remove sequence number and sequence letter from list of choices for image rename
(not yet implemented).
