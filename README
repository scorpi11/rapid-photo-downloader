Rapid Photo Downloader imports photos and videos from memory cards and other
devices at high speed. It can be configured to rename photos and videos with
meaningful filenames. It can back up photos and videos as they are downloaded.
It can download from and back up to multiple devices simultaneously, which is
valuable when importing from multiple memory cards or backing up to multiple
external drives. 

Written by a photographer for professional and amateur photographers, Rapid 
Photo Downloader is easy to configure and use. Program preferences are 
configured without the need for complicated codes. Common tasks can be 
automated, such as unmounting a memory card when the download is complete.

Downloading directly from a camera works only with some cameras. It works well
with some cameras, and not at all with others. For best performance, using a
memory card reader is recommended.
