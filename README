Rapid Photo Downloader is written by a photographer for professional and amateur
photographers. Released under the GNU GPL license, it is designed for use on the
Linux Desktop. It can download photos from multiple cameras, memory cards, and
Portable Storage Devices simultaneously. It provides many options for subfolder
creation, image renaming and backup.

It can download images directly from only from those cameras supported by
libgphoto2, and only on recent Linux distributions (those that contain gvfs).
This support is experimental. Some cameras do not work. If you cannot browse the 
camera's contents in a file manager (e.g. Nautilus), the camera download will
not work until the gvfs support is improved.

If you can put your camera into PTP mode, you may find it works a lot better.

Cameras that do not work when not in PTP mode as at May 2009 include the
Canon 20D and 300D.
