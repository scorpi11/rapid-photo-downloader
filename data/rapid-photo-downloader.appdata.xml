      Rapid Photo Downloader imports photos and videos from memory cards and 
      other devices at high speed. It can be configured to rename photos and 
      videos with meaningful filenames. It can back up photos and videos as 
      they are downloaded. It can download from and back up to multiple devices 
      simultaneously, which is valuable when importing from multiple memory
      cards or backing up to multiple external drives. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Written by a photographer for professional and amateur photographers, 
      Rapid Photo Downloader is easy to configure and use. Program preferences
      are configured without the need for complicated codes. Common tasks can be
      automated, such as unmounting a memory card when the download is complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downloading directly from a camera works only with some cameras. It works
      well with some cameras, and not at all with others. For best performance,
      using a memory card reader is recommended.
